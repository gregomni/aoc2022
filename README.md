This is actually AOC 2022 / 2023 / 2024 now.
I basically shove all the code for the old year into a folder and rewrite main() to point at the new year.
So the 2022 and 2023 puzzles aren't immediately runnable as is, but the code's all here. I also tend to rewrite the code for the 1st problem of the day while doing the 2nd problem, so the code as-is usually doesn't solve the first part any more, although all the pieces are there.
